This game relies on the pygame module to be run, so it needs to be intalled on the IDE you're using ("pip install pygame" should work - if not, there are some tutorials online that can explain it better than I could in a readme) 
Instructions on how to play are included in the startup menu, but this is pretty similar to the card game "Memory", if you've ever played that.
If you encounter an error, don't hesitate to shoot me an email :]
